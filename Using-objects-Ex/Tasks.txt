1. Write functions for working with shapes in  standard Planar coordinate system
   Points are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)
   Lines are represented by two points, marking their beginning and ending
   L(P1(X1,Y1),P2(X2,Y2))
   Calculate the distance between two points
   Check if three segment lines can form a triangle

2. Write a function that removes all elements with a given value
   Attach it to the array class
   Read about prototype and how to attach methods

3. Write a function that makes a deep copy of an object
   The function should work for both primitive and reference types

4. Write a function that checks if a given object contains a given property

5. Write a function that finds the youngest person in a given array of persons and prints his/hers full name
   Each person have properties firstname, lastname and age

6. Write a function that groups an array of persons by age, first or last name. The function must return an associative array, with keys - the groups, and values -arrays with persons in this groups
   Use function overloading (i.e. just one function)
