1. Write a client-side based web application that consists of a trash bucket and lots of trash items in the browser window. 
   Implement the following functionality:
   Drag trash items
   Open the bucket when a trash item is being dragged over it and close when the trash is dragged out of the bucket, or is dropped in the bucket
   To throw a trash item into the bucket, i.e. make it disappear from the browser window

2. Using the exercise with the bucket implement functionality for high-score
   When the user cleans all the trash, he is asked for a nickname and his score is saved in the local storage
   The score of the user is the time that took him to clean the trash
   Implement a high-score board, that is visible on page load and shows the top 5 scores 
   The 5 users that cleaned the trash fastest
